Thanks to the intensive literature study and discussions with peers, I understand why Dehmer and Emmert-Streib (2017) defined Data Science to deal with all aspects of data and why such a broad definition is needed.

In fact, this definition implies that there will be no shortage of jobs in Data Science, as Saxena (2021) claims. The traditional field of AI is complex questions, but even the most successful AI methods address simple questions (Emmert-Streib et al., 2020). This means the possibility of automating Data Scientists do not exist. Therefore, it is not surprising that economic works also conclude that "engineering activities" cannot be automated in the future (World Economic Forum, 2020). Instead, Josten and Lordan (2020) emphasised that "thinking" and "people" skills are increasingly critical. Both are core data science skills (Kenett & Redman, 2019). The argument of a peer to justify the concerns by the rapid development of quantum computers is also unfounded because the necessary algorithms do not yet exist and may never exist (Bennett et al., 1997; Biswas et al., 2017).

As identified by peers, the roles and responsibilities of data scientists change depending on the orientation and size of the company (What, 2020). Therefore, I use the umbrella term "Data Professional" (true to the module's name) for summarising possible responsibilities. Among others, a data professional must be able to accompany the entire data lifecycle (collection, processing, storage, management, analysis, visualisation and interpretation) (Dietrich, 2015). In-depth knowledge and application of data protection and information security management systems (ISO/IEC 27001, 2018) are just as central as knowledge of various process models and technologies such as Master Data Management (MDM), data mesh and data products (Strengholt, 2020). For example, a Data Professional must be able to advise that MDM should be considered if data is stable and truly matters or consider domain-specific approaches if the data is fast and fluid.

This is why such a loose definition, as proposed by Dehmer and Emmert-Streib (2017), is needed, and data science is a promising profession, albeit with downsides (Yildirim, 2020).
