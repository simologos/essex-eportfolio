The traditional field of AI is complex questions, but even the most successful AI methods address simple questions (Emmert-Streib et al., 2020). This means the possibility of automating Data Scientists do not exist. Therefore, it is not surprising that economic works also conclude that \\\"engineering activities\\\" cannot be automated in the future (World Economic Forum, 2020). Instead, Josten and Lordan (2020) emphasised that \\\"thinking\\\" and \\\"people\\\" skills are increasingly critical. Both are core data science skills (Kenett & Redman, 2019). The argument of a peer to justify the concerns by the rapid development of quantum computers is also unfounded because the necessary algorithms do not yet exist and may never exist (Bennett et al., 1997; Biswas et al., 2017).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As identified by peers, the roles and responsibilities of data scientists change depending on the orientation and size of the company (What, 2020).

Among others, a data professional must be able to accompany the entire data lifecycle (collection, processing, storage, management, analysis, visualisation and interpretation) (Dietrich, 2015). In-depth knowledge and application of data protection and information security management systems (ISO/IEC 27001, 2018) are just as central as knowledge of various process models and technologies such as Master Data Management (MDM), data mesh and data products (Strengholt, 2020).
