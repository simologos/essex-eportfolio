This article has contributed significantly to the term becoming a buzzword. The reasons are manifold. For example, data science deals with abstract concepts without physical form and uses methods such as artificial intelligence, which are often fraught with misunderstandings (Emmert-Streib et al., 2020). Soon after, a gold-rush atmosphere and slogans like \\\"data is the new oil\\\" dominated the press. Some authors began to calculate the value of the data. A calculation from 2012 states that, for example, each Facebook user is worth $116 (Bergstein & Orcutt, 2012). In 2016, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated a 27.4 per cent rise in the demand for data science skills through 2026 (Rieley, 2018).

Fast forward to 2017, Dehmer and Emmert-Streib (2017) define data science as a highly interdisciplinary field dealing with all aspects of data (e.g., analysis, legal aspects, skills, management etc.). This definition goes beyond data mining, business analytics, or statistical analysis.

For society in general, the research of Xiao and Mao (2021) suggests that postgraduate study fosters technological innovation. Specifically, the MSc Data Science course will drive innovation because it helps generate meaningful knowledge independent of the industry. In addition, it automatically helps to find meaning in the buzzword \\\"Data Science\\\" mentioned at the beginning because well-trained data scientists are released into the economy and help to correct false expectations.
