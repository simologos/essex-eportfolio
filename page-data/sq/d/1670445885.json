This paper presents an e-portfolio created for the \"Deciphering Big Data\" module at the University of Essex. The e-portfolio includes the required components specified by the module guidelines and allows students to delve into independently chosen topics within big data. Furthermore, the e-portfolio documents the student's learning successes throughout the module. It highlights progression, growth, and achievements in knowledge acquisition, skill development, and applying theoretical concepts to practical scenarios. Additionally, it emphasises active participation and contributions to group projects, demonstrating the ability to collaborate effectively and produce high-quality outputs.","selected":true,"priority":1,"links":[]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/simologos.github.io/simologos.github.io/example/content/research/bigData/index.md"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":null,"date":"2022-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","venue":"","authors":["[Simon Egli](https://www.simonegli.com/)"],"path":"research/dp1","title":"Collaborative Learning Discussion 1","tags":["MSc Data Science","Data Professional"],"excerpt":"The Data Professional: Collaborative Learning Discussion 1, summary post","selected":true,"priority":20,"links":[]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/simologos.github.io/simologos.github.io/example/content/research/dpDiscussion1/index.md"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":null,"date":"2022-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","venue":"","authors":["[Simon Egli](https://www.simonegli.com/)"],"path":"research/induction","title":"Is an MSc in data science worth it?","tags":["MSc Data Science","Induction Module"],"excerpt":"PG Induction Assignment: Discussion of the importance of a postgraduate degree in the Computer Science field","selected":true,"priority":20,"links":[]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/simologos.github.io/simologos.github.io/example/content/research/induction/index.md"}}]}}}
